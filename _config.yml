user_description: I am a postdoctoral researcher in Geophysics/Geodynamics at the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford, and I use numerical models to study dynamics of plate boundaries (subduction, continental collision and mid-ocean ridges). I am interested in understanding long-term deformation of plate boundaries, how they deform in the presence or absence of magma, and how magma is generated and transported in the mantle and lithosphere. Since Nov 2021, I have also been a Stipendiary Lecturer in Earth Sciences (Geophysics) affiliated with Exeter College, Oxford.
