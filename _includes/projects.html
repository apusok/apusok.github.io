    <h3> Magma dynamics at Mid-Ocean Ridges and Rifts </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>RIFT-O-MAT Project</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How does magmatism promote and shape rifts in continental and oceanic lithosphere? In this project, we plan to focus on magma generation and transport at spreading ridges, but also on deformation of host rock to investigate processes such as diking and faulting. We are also developing numerical tools that are suitable for magma dynamics theory with visco-elasto-plastic rheology. </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Methods, practices, philosophy of geodynamic modelling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The COVID pandemic made us (the authors) to transform an EGU course into this collaborative perspectives paper. The paper aims to be an introduction to geodyanmic modelling for students or non-geodynamicists, but also invites feedback from a more expert audience. We cover the general mathematical theory, numerical methods, designing and performing numerical investigations, to data and software availability, and communication.</p>

      <li>Link between subduction, sediments, upper plate parameters</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Subduction zones represent the only major pathway by which continental material (sediments) can be returned to the Earthâ€™s mantle. When sediments are considered, convergent margins appear to fall into one of two classes: accretionary and erosive. In this study, we run systematic 2-D simulations of ocean-continent subduction to investigate how sediment fluxes influence subduction dynamics and the plate coupling.</p>

    <h3> Same-dip double subduction </h3>

      <li>India-Eurasia convergence history</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Same-dip double subduction is a special tectonic configuration, where two slabs dip in the same direction. Examples exist for the India-Asia and the present day Ryukyu-Izu-Bonin-Mariana (Pacific, Philippines Sea Plates) settings. We run 2-D and 3-D models to investigate the formation and stability of double subduction, and we propose a new sequence of events for the India-Asia convergence history.</p>

    <h3> Topography in 3-D continental collision models </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Topography (free surface) analysis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Himalayas, the Tibetan Plateau, or the Andes are remarkable features on the surface of the Earth. However, it is unclear how they formed or why they are so high. In this project, we ran lots of 3-D simulations of subduction/collision to understand how high topography (>5km) is formed. And it turns out it's not so easy to build topography in numerical models. However, we do provide semi-analytical insights on the conditions necessary for building high mountains and plateaus. </p>

    <h3> Rheological approximations in 3-D subduction/collision models </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Slab break-off modes due to rheology </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Rocks deform in a visco-elasto-plastic manner, which is difficult to solve numerically (nonlinear system) and the coefficients are poorly constrained from observations and laboratory experiments. So, previous numerical studies used various approximations for rock rheology. In this study, we investigate the effect of such rheological approximations in a 3-D subduction/collision model. </p>

        <h3> Magma dynamics at Mid-Ocean Ridges (MORs) - MSc project</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Two-phase flow models</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Oceanic crust and most of volcanism on Earth are produced at MORs (divergent plate boundaries). As the plates move laterally, the mantle is decompressed and the mantle rock starts melting. Buoyant melt will tend to move upwards forming an interconnected network of pores and channels. Generation, transport and extrusion/emplacement of melt in the lithosphere are still major questions. We model the interaction between melt and the solid mantle and address questions such as: Is the flow beneath mid-ocean ridges entirely passive, or there is also an active component due to magma dynamics? How is magma being transported from the mantle asthenosphere to the surface?  </p>
